### Project Overview
This project involves reimplementing a **Transformer model** from scratch to explore its applications in **natural language processing (NLP)** tasks.

### Key Contributions:
- Implemented a **Transformer model** and applied it to **text classification** and **natural language generation**.
- Compared its performance with **mainstream libraries**, gaining insights into **scalability and optimization**.
- Deepened understanding of **attention mechanisms** and **neural network training**.
