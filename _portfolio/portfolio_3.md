### Project Overview
Reconstructed an **Open-Unmix neural network model** for **audio source separation**, particularly for **AI-driven music analysis**.

### Key Contributions:
- Implemented and trained the model for **musical instrument separation** tasks.
- Applied **deep learning** and **audio spectrogram processing** techniques to improve separation accuracy.
- Gained expertise in **LSTM architectures**, **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, and **neural network training pipelines** for real-world datasets.
