I am an undergraduate student at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/), pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** and a **B.S. in Applied Mathematics & Statistics**, with a cumulative GPA of **3.918**. My work centers on building intelligent systems that connect large language models, structured reasoning, and real-world scientific and clinical applications.

My research interest spans **LLM agents**, **AI for health and science**, and **multimodal & reinforcement learning methods**.

I am currently an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** in the **Emory Graph Mining (EGM) Lab**, advised by **Dr. Carl Yang**, where I develop:

- Hypergraph-transformer models for clinical risk prediction  
- LLM-based medical retrieval agents  
- Self-play retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks  
- Foundation-model pipelines for biomedical journal analysis  
- KG-guided reasoning models for interpretable disease detection

I am also a research assistant in the **Department of Mathematics**, where I apply reinforcement learning to scientific computing — specifically, multigrid tuning strategies for HYPRE.

Previously, I’ve interned at **JD.com** and **Tongcheng Holdings**, working on:

- High-fidelity LoRA image generation  
- Speaker diarization & model optimization  
- LLM-based evaluation frameworks for AI-driven travel assistants
