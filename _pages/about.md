## About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/), with a strong focus on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**. I have a solid foundation in mathematics and programming, proficient in **Python** and **PyTorch**, and well-versed in **machine learning** and **deep learning** algorithms. Academically, I maintain an outstanding GPA of **3.97/4.0** and have been named to the **Deanâ€™s List** for three consecutive times.

## Research Experience

I am currently an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at the **Emory Graph Mining (EGM) Group**, advised by **Prof. Carl Yang**. My research focuses on **HyperGraph Neural Networks** and their applications in **electronic health records (EHR)**. Specifically, I leverage **contrastive learning** and **transfer learning** to enhance predictive accuracy in medical datasets. Our research has been submitted to **AIME Journal**, where I am listed as the **third author**.

Additionally, I actively contribute to the **MedAssist** project, utilizing **large language models (LLMs)** to improve medical record comprehension. Our work has been accepted at **WWW 2025**, also with me as the **third author**.

## Projects

I am passionate about applying deep learning across various domains. In my coursework, I have implemented **Transformer models** to explore their applications in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and reproduced the **Open-Unmix model**, investigating neural networks in **audio source separation**.

In software development, I have worked on projects such as:
- An **online coding evaluation platform**.
- A **facility rating system**.
- Gained extensive experience in **backend development**.

## Competitions & Leadership

I thrive in team collaborations and have led projects in **data science competitions**:
- Led a team in the **2024 Emory University DataFest**, analyzing educational platform data and proposing optimizations, earning the **Best Team & Data Insights Award**.
- Participated in the **Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM)**, where I was responsible for algorithm design and programming (results pending).
