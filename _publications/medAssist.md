### Abstract
Effectively comprehending diagnosis and treatment plans remains a **significant challenge** for both medical professionals and patients, particularly when dealing with **rare diseases** or **complex comorbidities**. 

We present **MedAssist**, a **large language model (LLM)-empowered medical assistant** designed to support **EHR (electronic health records) comprehension**. MedAssist incorporates two key capabilities:
- **Medical knowledge retrieval**: Extracting relevant clinical guidelines and best practices from medical literature.
- **Data retrieval**: Analyzing diagnosis and treatment plans of similar patients within EHR databases.

By integrating these capabilities into an interactive AI system, MedAssist improves **knowledge accessibility** and **clinical decision-making**, reducing the burden of heavy data engineering for clinicians. The research has been **accepted to TheWebConf 2025 (Demo Track)** but is **not yet published**.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models · Medical AI · EHR Analysis · Clinical Decision Support.
