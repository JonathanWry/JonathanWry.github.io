### Abstract
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major complication following an **embolic stroke of an undetermined source (ESUS)**, significantly increasing the risk of **recurrent stroke and mortality**. Traditional diagnostic methods suffer from limitations in accuracy, scalability, and cost. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potential solution but struggles with data scarcity and high-dimensional medical features.

To address these challenges, we propose a **pre-training and transfer learning** approach for AF prediction in ESUS patients. We pre-train **hypergraph-based patient embedding models** on a large stroke cohort (**AI-RESPECT, 7780 samples**) to capture key patient characteristics and interactions. The learned embeddings are then **transferred** to a smaller ESUS cohort (**510 samples**) to enhance predictive accuracy while reducing feature dimensionality.

Our experimental results demonstrate that both **supervised and unsupervised pre-training approaches** outperform traditional ML models applied directly to raw data, improving prediction **accuracy and robustness**. By leveraging **pre-training and transfer learning**, our method effectively addresses the challenges of **small sample sizes** and **high-dimensional data**, providing a scalable and efficient **AI-driven solution** for AF prediction in stroke patients.
