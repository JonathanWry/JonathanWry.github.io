Predicting atrial fibrillation (AF) in embolic stroke of an undetermined source (ESUS) is challenging due to data scarcity and high-dimensional features. We propose a pre-training and transfer learning approach using hypergraph-based patient embeddings, improving accuracy and robustness over traditional models for AF prediction.
